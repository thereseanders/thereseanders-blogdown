This three-day intensive workshop provides Ph.D. students with the computing skills necessary to create advanced data visualizations in `R`. The course focuses on the grammar of graphics and its implementation via `ggplot2`, and provides introductions to data management using the `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `lubridate` packages. It also contains a primer on visualizing spatial data using the `ggmap` and `sf` packages in `R`. Course materials are available on [Github](https://github.com/thereseanders/workshop-dataviz-fsu).
