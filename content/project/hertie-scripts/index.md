The workshop series creates a space for faculty and researchers at the Hertie School and SCRIPTS to efficiently catch up with recent developments in data science topics and tools. 

This workshop series is geared toward learning basic data management in `R`. This includes tasks like manipulating variables, creating new variables, subsetting data, reshaping data, merging, and introductory regular expression applications. It also covers data visualization in `R`.
