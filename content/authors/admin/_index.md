I am a postdoctoral research fellow and data scientist at the [Hertie School Data Science Lab](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab/) and [SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu) Data and Methodology Center in Berlin. I defended my dissertation to graduate from the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/poir/) (USC) with a Ph.D. in Political Science and International Relations in 2019. 

My research focuses on the estimation of territorial control and subnational conflict exposure in civil wars using machine learning and geo-coded event data. As an intern at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), I worked on implementing peer review in data science classes via the [`ghclass`](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/articles/peer.html) package. I served as the Director of Research and Training for USC's [Security and Political Economy (SPEC) Lab](http://uscspec.org) and teach math for social science, [data management](https://github.com/thereseanders/Workshop-DataManagement-tidyverse), and [visualization](https://github.com/thereseanders/workshop-dataviz-fsu).
