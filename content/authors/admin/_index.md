Therese Anders is a Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science and International Relations](https://dornsife.usc.edu/poir/) at the University of Southern California. Her dissertation focuses on the development of new estimates of territorial control and subnational conflict exposure in civil wars using machine learning and geo-coded event data. 

Therese is interning with  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) on implementing calibrated peer review in data science classes via the [`ghclass`](https://github.com/rundel/ghclass) package. She served as the Director of Research and Training for the [Security and Political Economy (SPEC) Lab](http://uscspec.org) and teaches math for social science, [data wrangling](https://github.com/thereseanders/Workshop-DataManagement-tidyverse), and [visualization](https://github.com/thereseanders/workshop-dataviz-fsu).
